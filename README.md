# PolyDeobfuscated

Clean, readable, and deobfuscated source of PolyTrack, rebuilt for analysis, modding, and understanding.

## Tools

### [IMap](./tools/imap/)

IMap is a tool used for generating the source maps for PolyTrack. It can be used to deobfuscate the code and make it more readable. This is the main tool you will be using to work with the source code.

## General Reminders

- Do not commit the `source_maps` folder.
- You are not modifying the structure of the code, just the obfuscated names.
- Do not push changes to the upstream repository. Instead, create a pull request to the repo.
- Do not modify the `original` folder. This folder contains the original obfuscated code and should remain unchanged.
